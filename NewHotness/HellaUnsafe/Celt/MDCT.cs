       to do most of the work. It should be relatively straightforward to
       plug in pretty much and FFT here.

       This replaces the Vorbis FFT (and uses the exact same API), which
       was a bit too messy and that was ending up duplicating code
       (might as well use the same FFT everywhere).

       The algorithm is similar to (and inspired from) Fabrice Bellard's
       MDCT implementation in FFMPEG, but has differences in signs, ordering
       and scaling in many places.
